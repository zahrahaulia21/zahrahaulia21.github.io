#	[Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Property Data](https://github.com/zahrahaulia21/zahrahaulia_portfolio/blob/main/EDA%20for%20Property%20Data.ipynb)

This is a group project for Data Mining and Business Intelligence course.

* Dataset was given by the lecturer, but we collected data from property website to complete the data.
* The data contains detailed information about houses for sale in provinces in Indonesia.
* Doing data preprocessing, such as handling missing values and outliers, standardizing data formats.
* Doing data exploratoration to answer some questions such as is there a tendency for houses in one city to be more expensive/cheaper than in other cities, recommendation which city should the new branch office located in, the characteristics of the most sold houses, house recommendations that will potentially generate profits for the company, etc.

This is a group project for Data Mining and Business Intelligence course.

* Dataset was given by the lecturer.
* The data is a survey result from workers in Indonesia.
* Doing data cleansing, handling noisy data, and doing data preprocessing that is adjusted to the data mining steps that will be carried out.
* Building linear regression model to find out the characteristic that tend to have higher level of mental health disorder (Insight 1), and building obesity classification model to find the feature importances using random forest (Insight 3).
