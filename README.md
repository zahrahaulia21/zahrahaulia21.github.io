# Zahrah Aulia's Portfolio

#	[Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Property Data](https://github.com/zahrahaulia21/zahrahaulia_portfolio/blob/main/EDA%20for%20Property%20Data.ipynb)

This is a group project for Data Mining and Business Intelligence course.

* Data was given by the lecturer, but we collected data from property website to complete the data.
* The data contains detailed information about houses for sale in provinces in Indonesia.
* Doing data preprocessing, such as handling missing values and outliers, standardizing data formats.
